    "**What is a Sentiment Analysis and why is it useful?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis represents the use of Natural Language Processing to determine the attitude, opinions and emotions of a speaker, writer or other subject within an online mention. In other words, it is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive or negative. A human is able to recognize and classify a text into positive or negative. However, a computer not but can learn to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "**On which topic?**\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to perform a sentiment analysis on Tweets about the late blockbuster release: Joker, with Joaquin Phoenix. Out in the USA beginning of October 2019 and throughout theaters in the world later on, no doubt that Joker has divided its audience. Whether people love or hate it, the reactions were numerous. I saw it myself at the movies in Switzerland as soon as it came out, and felt exactly this way: divided. The movie received a Golden Lion win at the Venice Film Festival, I had high expectations. The complex personality of the Joker was one of the reasons I wanted to see the movie. But after visioning it, I realized it had a strong impact on me, more than expected and not only positive. The critics I read afterwards were also two-folds, both positive and negative. Therefore, I thought it would be interesting to train a classification model on Tweets on the topic of Joker. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Who is interested?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Different types of people could be interested to know the proportion of positive vs negative tweets on this topic: fans of Joaquin Phoenix and of The Dark Knight Rises, owners of movies, producers, script writers, psychologists and psychiatrists. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology**\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be using the Twitter API to collect a Test set based on keywords. A function will return a list of tweets that contain our keywords selected. Each tweet’s text will see itself attributed a label (‘positive’ or ‘negative’) to classify each tweet as positive or negative. The Training set will be downloaded because it has to be labelled into ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ on a big amount of tweets. The Training set is critical to the success of the model since our model will “learn” how to do create a sentiment analysis based on the Training set. "

    "The next segment of the code deals with getting the text of tweets based on the IDs. We loop through the tweets in corpus, calling the API on every tweet to get the Tweet.Status object of the particular tweet. Afterwards, we use that same object (status) to get the text associated with it and push it into the trainingDataSet then sleep (i.e. pause execution) for five minutes (900/180 seconds) in order to abide by the request limit we talked about.\n",

    "Before we move on to the actual classification section, there is some cleaning up to do. As a matter of fact, this step is critical and usually takes a long time when building Machine Learning models. However, this will not be a problem in our task, as the data we have is relatively consistent. In other words, we know exactly what we need from it. I will express on this matter later on.\n",

    "Words are the most important part (to an extent that we will talk about in the upcoming section). However, when it comes to things like punctuation, you cannot get the sentiment from punctuation. Therefore, punctuation does not matter to Sentiment Analysis. Moreover, tweet components like images, videos, URLs, usernames, emojis, etc. do not contribute to the polarity (whether it is positive or negative) of the tweet. However, this is only true for this application. For instance, in another application, we could have a Deep Learning image classifier that learns and predicts whether this image that the tweet contains stands for something positive (e.g. a rainbow) or negative (e.g. a tank). When it comes to the technicality, both Sentiment Analysis and Deep Learning fall under Machine Learning. In fact, we can perform Sentiment Analysis through Deep Learning, but that’s a story for another day.\n",

By transforming the words into a standard format, later operations can be done on the data without compromising the process. Many pre-processing steps can be taken including: lowercasing, stemming (example: troubled, troubles go into 'troubl'), lemmatization (example: troubled, troubles to into 'trouble'), stopword removal, normalizing, noise removal... \n",

    "1. We start off by our imported libraries. re is Python’s Regular Expressions (RegEx) library, which takes care of parsing strings and modifying them in an efficient way without having to explicitly iterate through the characters comprising the particular string. We also imported ntlk, is the Natural Processing Toolkit, which is one of the most commonly used Python libraries out there. It takes care of any processing that we need to perform on text to change its form or extract certain components from it. The class constructor removes stop words. This is a relatively big topic that you can read up on later, as it is more into Natural Language Processing and less related to our topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The processTweets function loops through all the tweets input into it, calling its neighboring function processTweet on every tweet in the list. The latter does the actual pre-processing steps: \n",
    "    - Removing stop words in english: stopr words are a set of commonly used words in a language (a, the, is, are,...). The idea behing removing these words is to remove low informtion words from the text and focus on the important words instead. \n",
    "    - Making all the text in lower-case letters. This is merely because, in almost all programming languages, “cAr” is not interpreted the same way as “car”. Therefore, it is better to normalize all characters to be lower-case across all our data. \n",
    "    - URLs and usernames are removed from the tweet. This is for the reasons we disclosed earlier.\n",
    "    - The number sign (i.e. #) is removed from every hashtag, in order to avoid hashtags being processed differently than regular words.\n",
    "    - Duplicate characters are rid off of, in order to ensure that no important word goes unprocessed even if it is spelled out in an unusual way (e.g. “caaaaar” becomes “car”). \n",
    "    - Finally, the tweet’s text is broken into words (tokenized) in order to ease its processing in the upcoming stages. This step is also called text segmentation or lexical analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take an example. The following tweet could be present in the data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"@person1 retweeted @person2: Corn has got to be the most delllllicious crop in the world!!!! #corn #thoughts...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Our pre-processor will result in the tweet looking like:\n",
    "\n",
    "“AT_USER rt AT_USER corn has got to be the most delicious crop in the world corn thoughts”\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, the tokenization will result in:\n",
    "\n",
    "{“corn”, “most”, “delicious”, “crop”, “world”, “corn”, “thoughts”}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that our code removed duplicate characters in words as we metioned earlier (i.e. “delllllicious” became “delicious”). However, it did not remove duplicate words (i.e. “corn”) from the text, but rather kept them. This is because duplicate word play a role in determining the polarity of the text (as we will see in the upcoming section).\n",
    "\n",
    "We are all set to use our Pre-processor class. First, we will create a variable that refers to it (an object), and then call it on both the Training and Test sets as we discussed earlier:"

    "## Section D: Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Naive Bayes Classifier?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes Classifier is a classification algorithm that relies on Bayes’ Theorem. This theorem provides a way of calculating a type or probability called posterior probability, in which the probability of an event A occurring is reliant on probabilistic known background (e.g. event B evidence). For example, if Person_X only plays tennis when it is not raining outside, then, according to Bayesian statistics, the probability of Person_X playing tennis when it is not raining can be given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X plays | no rain) = P(no rain | X plays)*P(x plays)/P(no rain)\n",
    "\n",
    "following Bayes’ theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Naive Bayes Classifier?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes (NB) are mostly used in natural language processing problems. Naive Bayes predicts the tag of a text by calculating the probability of each tag for a given text and then output the tag with the highest one. It is the most simplest one which is enough in our case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other possible classifier:  \n",
    "- Support Vector Machine: \n",
    "    - effective in high dimensional spaces;\n",
    "    - still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples\n",
    "    - uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient (very important too!)\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Conclusion:** SVM could be a good option too. Since we need to choose one, we will work with NB. \n",
    "\n",
    "All we need to know for our task is that a Naive Bayes Classifier depends on the ever-famous Bayes’ theorem. Before we move on, let’s give a quick overview of the steps we will be taking next:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a vocabulary (list of words) of all the words resident in our training data set.\n",
    "- Match tweet content against our vocabulary — word-by-word.\n",
    "- Build our word feature vector.\n",
    "- Plug our feature vector into the Naive Bayes Classifier."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is an interesting way to think about the applicability of Natural Language Processing in making automated conclusions about text. It is being utilized in social media trend analysis and, sometimes, for marketing purposes. Making a Sentiment Analysis program in Python is not a difficult task, thanks to modern-day, ready-for-use libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this project, we wanted to analyze Tweets about the late released movie \"Joker\" that attracted all kinds of comments, critics on the web. In summary, we have \n",
    "\n",
    "- created a Test set directly from Twitter thanks to the API\n",
    "- used an existing Training set that was classified into positive and negative tweets according to its content by hand\n",
    "- cleaned both sets by removing any signs (punctuation, hashtags...) that do not bring anything to the sentiment analysis\n",
    "- created a vocabulary of words based on the Training Set\n",
    "- matched tweets against vocabulary \n",
    "- trained the classifier \n",
    "- tested the model on the test Set\n",
    "- evaluated the performance of our model\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the sentiment analysis is that almost half of the Tweets in the Test set are classified as negative and the other half as positive. The results show the divided critics about the movie, which is a feeling I had when scanning through articles on the web. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the quality of our model seems compromised, and several areas of improvement have been identified above.\n",
    "I would not use the model per se, but most probably after implementing the different changes mentionned above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another area of improvement to the model is in regards to measuring the performance of our model. The way the project was conducted didn't allow to use a solid model performance tool such as a confusion matrix. What could be done to measure better the model's performance would be to: \n",
    "- separate the Training Tweets Dataset between Train and Test sets\n",
    "- develop and train the model on the Train set\n",
    "- use Test set to test model\n",
    "- run metrics (confusion matrix) to evaluate model's performance over Test set and Train set"
